Cover the entire scalp, especially the frontal hairline and crown, with an abundance of thick, dense, short hair. There should be absolutely no bald spots anywhere on the head. Completely erase any sign of a receding hairline, replacing it with a strong, low, and perfectly full hairline. The final result must be a super dense, full head of hair that looks completely restored and youthful, styled in a short haircut. Ensure the new hair's color and texture blend flawlessly with any existing hair. Do not change any other part of the image.",

    name: "Liposuction",
    description: "Fat removal",
    icon: "üí™",

The resulting skin should appear smoother and more radiant. Crucially, the new skin surface must look completely natural and not AI-generated.

    description: "Wrinkle reduction",
    icon: "‚ú®",

Smooth out the dynamic wrinkles on the forehead (horizontal lines), between the eyebrows (glabellar or '11' lines), and at the corners of the eyes ('crow's feet').
